# react-object
represent DOM elements as objects in React, alternative to jsx

## Benefits
- One templating language
- Programmatically compose components inline (map, conditionals, etc)
- Javascript everywhere, no XML
- Better use of es6 operators (spread)
- One file type
- Simple wrapper around React.createElement
- Works with existing components written in jsx

## Usage

## TODO
- documentation and example
- Unit Test
- extend and export React
- better method of hooking into react (class, mixin)
- Object validator
